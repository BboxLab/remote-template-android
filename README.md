remote-template-android
=======================

Basic template using the android 2nd screen library


Known issues:
* The settings part allows to modify manually the Bbox Ip address, but this has no effect. The only way to connect to a Bbox is the Automatic detection at startup
* The Anymote library is currently incompatible with Android 5.1. The remote part will not respond. SDK Remote will be added later when published by Google
