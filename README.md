remote-template-android
=======================

Basic template using the android 2nd screen library of BboxAPI

The remote part is handled by the Anymote library:
* [Anymote library](https://code.google.com/p/googletv-android-samples/source/browse/#git%2FAnymoteLibrary)
* [Anymote protocol](https://developers.google.com/tv/remote/docs/anymote)
* [Samples](https://developers.google.com/tv/remote/docs/samples)

Known issues:
* The settings part allows to modify manually the Bbox Ip address, but this has no effect. The only way to connect to a Bbox is the Automatic detection at startup

NB : 

Master branch : for Android 4.1

1.4 branch : for Android TV 5.1
